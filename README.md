# The Intent Web  I2I Protocol

The Intent Web introduces **Interface Sovereignty**, a new paradigm that gives users
full control over the way they experience and interact with their data.

Instead of relying on static, developer-built front-ends, users generate dynamic,
personalized interfaces through intelligent agents.

This repository hosts the foundational documents for the **Intent-to-Interface (I2I) Protocol**, including the whitepaper, technical design specification (TDS), and roadmap.

## 🧩 What is the Intent Web?

The Intent Web replaces static, pre-built user interfaces with **dynamic, agent-generated interfaces**.

Users simply express intent in natural language, and intelligent agents produce a secure,
declarative UI schema that renders instantly across web, mobile, and desktop.

This enables:

- Ownership of the interface layer  
- Local-first, privacy-preserving experiences  
- Cross-platform deterministic rendering  
- AI-driven customization without developers  
- A decentralized agent marketplace

## 🧠 The I2I Pipeline

```
User Intent → Intent Object → I2I Schema → Renderer → UI
```

The pipeline is deterministic, secure, and governed by a multi-agent architecture.

---

## 🔐 Security Philosophy

- Declarative UIs only, no executable code  
- Cryptographically signed schemas  
- Certified and sandboxed components  
- WASM-based isolation  
- Flexible trust model  
  - DAO-certified components  
  - Community-vetted open-source modules  
  - User-local custom components

## 🌐 Ecosystem

The Intent Web ecosystem includes:

- **Users**: express intent, own interface schemas  
- **Agent Providers**:intent parsers, schema generators, domain agents  
- **Renderer Providers**: React, Flutter, CLI, AR renderers  
- **Framework Builders**: design systems, accessibility modules  
- **Data Providers**: on-chain, off-chain, decentralized storage  
- **The Intent Web DAO**: governance, certification, standards  

Each role contributes to a self-sustaining protocol economy.

## 🛣 Roadmap (Summary)

1. **MVP**:Intent → Schema → Renderer pipeline  
2. **Agent Marketplace**: Open registry with micropayments  
3. **Cross-Platform Rendering**: React, Flutter, CLI  
4. **DAO Governance**: Component certification + protocol votes  
5. **Protocol Expansion**:Multi-agent systems, federated compute  

Full roadmap available in the PDF above.
